# KiraKiraKasa (Led Umbrella)
This is a just for fun project to add leds to an ubrella and play preprogrammed animations from an SD card. The animations can be created and verified with a small Simulator I wrote in python using the pygame library or visualization.

# What can you do with it?
When you push a button the leds on the umbrella will start looping through an animation. pushing the button again will switch to the next animation.

# Prerequisites
* Pi-pico
* WS2812B LED-strip (with at least 118 LEDs)
* SD card shield
* SD card
* Push Button
* Portable Charger
* wires
* Umbrella (preferably white)

First create an animation on your PC. Verify you like the animation using the pygame animation on your PC. Copy the created animation file to the sd card. Plug the sd card into the umbrella system. Enjoy your animations.
